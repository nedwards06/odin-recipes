        <ul>
            <li>Precooked microwave bacon</li>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

            <li>Buy the bacon. (Hint: Wal-Mart usually has a good selection.)</li>
            <li>Open the box and inner plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Place 1/2 of the bacon on a paper plate. (Note: You may need

            </li>
            <li>Place the paper plate with bacon in the microwave. If possible,
                use a plastic microwave plate cover to contain the grease splatter.
                (You can get these covers at Ikea for just a few dollars.)

            <li>Cook on high for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 3-5 for the other 1/2 of the bacon.</li>
